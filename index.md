> “The derivative, as this notion appears in the elementary differential calculus, is a familiar mathematical example of a function for which both [the domain and the range] consist of functions. Or, turning to the integral calculus, if in the expression <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int^{1}_0(f x)dx"> we take the function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f"> as independent variable, we are led to a function for which the range of arguments consists of functions and the range of values, of numbers.”

# Mila Computer Calculus Reading Group

Calculus is a subject which has attracted a great deal of interest in scientific computing. Each week, we will read a paper or two and hold a short discussion. All are welcome.

## Schedule

TBD.

## Reading Materials

Some recent papers in differentiable and probabilistic programming which we may discuss. Feel free to choose a paper to present!
