> "The derivative, as this notion appears in the elementary differential calculus, is a familiar mathematical example of a function for which both [the domain and the range] consist of functions. Or, turning to the integral calculus, if in the expression <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\int^{1}_0(f x)dx"> we take the function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f"> as independent variable, we are led to a function for which the range of arguments consists of functions and the range of values, of numbers."

In ancient times, our ancestors used small pebbles to encode and
manipulate abstract quantities according to a small set of rules. In
effect, they were trading mental for mechanical labor. With the advent
of pen and paper, those same rules could be translated into written
symbols and more recently, electrical impulses and transistors.

Today we make the same trade when implementing mathematical algorithms:
one can either spend a great deal of effort manipulating an expression
with pen and paper, then implement the result as a computer program, or
we could implement the rules, then let the computer manipulate the
expression on our behalf. We call this exchange *calculus*.

Modern calculus is a topic with a variety of applications in classical
and statistical computing. Broadly, it encompasses any formal system for
manipulating symbolic expressions according to a fixed set of rules. We
are specifically interested in its applications to computer programming.
Each week, we will read a paper and hold a short discussion. All are
welcome to attend.

We define an equality relation indexed by rationals: a =<sub>ε</sub> b which we think of as saying that “a is approximately equal to b up to an error of ε”. We have 4 interesting examples where we have a quantitative equational theory whose free algebras correspond to well known structures. The most interesting example comes from the case of the Kantorovich metric.

The question then becomes, which ones, what is an adequate 'source' language for describing them, and when is such an approach effective. This talk will meander through these questions, giving answers that have emerged from our work on the Drasil system. While far from a silver bullet, an interesting subset of software does emerge that can be effectively attacked in this way.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Jacques Carette](https://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~carette/)                     |
| Mar. 19, 9:30 am  | [Automatic Reparameterisation of Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03028.pdf)<br/>-[Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6yBChnW3nE), [slides](/public/gorinova/autoreparam.pdf), [Stan tutorial](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/divergences_and_bias.html)<br/><details>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms can be used to approximate a probability distribution by continuously sampling from it. Some MCMC strategies, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), use the gradient of the unnormalised density function to increase the quality of the obtained samples and the speed of convergence of the algorithm. But such algorithms can fail, and often silently, if the curvature of this target density function varies. One way to work around this problem is to reparameterise the distribution of interest, meaning to express it in terms of different parameters.<br/>In this talk, I will describe the practical challenges of finding a suitable reparameterisation, and demonstrate how we can use mechanisms available in recent probabilistic programming languages to implement a family of parameterisations often used in practice. In particular, we will look at a continuous relaxation of the question of what parameterisation to use and combine it with variational inference to obtain robust and efficient MCMC samplers.</details> | [Maria Gorinova](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1207807/)                    |
| Mar. 26, 12:00 pm | Inside Every Calculus Is A Little Algebra Waiting To Get Out<br/><details>Because of deep learning, there has been a surge in interest in automatic differentiation, especially from the functional programming community. As a result there are many recent papers that look at AD from a Category Theory perspective. However, Category Theorists have already been looking at differentiation and calculus in general since the late 60’s in the context of Synthetic Differential Geometry, but it seems that this work is largely ignored by those interested in AD. In this talk, we will provide a gentle introduction to the ideas of SDG, by relating them to dual numbers, and show how it provides a simple and purely algebraic approach to (automatic) differentiation.</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [Erik Meijer](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=odFMpOYAAAAJ)         |

For such expressions, it is often necessary to obtain first and second-order derivatives. In my talk, I will present two algorithmic approaches for computing such matrix and tensor derivatives. Both approaches can be used for symbolic as well as for forward and reverse mode algorithmic differentiation. Experiments show a speedup between two and three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch when evaluating higher-order derivatives.<br/>An online interface to our approach can be found at [http://www.MatrixCalculus.org](http://www.MatrixCalculus.org).</details>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Sören Laue](https://theinf2.informatik.uni-jena.de/People/Soeren+Laue.html) |

## Reading Materials

A few recent papers on differential, integral and logical calculi are listed for illustrative purposes below, following the general theme of topics we plan to discuss. Other suggested reading materials are also welcome!

### Differential

Differentiable programming concerns the calculus of infinitesimal change and change propagation through a computation graph. This subject is the original and primary focus of this reading group.

### Integral

We will also discuss some topics in automatic integration or probabilistic programming, i.e. the study of volume, density and how to derive their exact or approximate quantity.
