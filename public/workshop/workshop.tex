% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

    \begin{abstract}
        Automatic differentiation libraries and frameworks have enabled much progress in gradient-based learning over the last decade. Recent domain-specific languages for automatic programming hold the promise of unleashing similar progress in e.g., probabilistic and classical reasoning. Concurrently, machines have made steady progress in representing and synthesizing programs. Other workshops have explored these themes separately, yet few have highlighted the interplay between automatic and synthetic programming, a situation we hope to remedy.

    \section{Introduction}

    Neural information processing systems have benefited tremendously from the availability of programming languages and abstractions for automatic differentiation. Similar domain-specific languages have begun to automate inference in other logical disciplines, such as probabilistic and classical logic, and related message passing schemes on tree- and graph-structured data.

    Not only does machine learning itself benefit from tools and languages for programmable inference, learning can also be seen as a kind of programming language which humans program indirectly, and which is increasingly capable of emitting human-readable procedures. Early examples of synthetic functions of this sort are starting to emerge, thanks to recent progress in statistical langauge modeling, resembing procedures a human programmer might plausibly write by hand.

    Using techniques from programmable inference to transform and generate programs, and adapting insights gained developing those programs to drive innovation in AD and probabilistic programming is a virtuous cycle, with a growing stream of software and academic papers. We envision collaboration between automatic and synthetic programming will continue to unlock deeper insights as researchers become more accustomed to outsourcing low-level reasoning tasks to these systems.

    Many ideas have been reinvented and rediscovered in this process. AD was invented over a half a dozen times over the last century and research continues to reveal unexpected connections to implicit differentiation, optimal control, stochastic processes and differential equations. Semiring programming has existed in various forms for many decades and shares deep connections to reinforcement learning, structured inference and probabilistic programming. Much work remains.

    Likewise, many recent topics in machine learning have been well-studied in the programming language literature. For example, functional and type-safe programming are lingua franca in PL circles but relatively new to Python, the primary language used in machine learning. The duality between code and data is well-known in PL under the ageis of homoiconicity. Other PLs have thought deeply about higher-order functions, currying, partial application, and denotational and operational semantics, which enables routines to interoperate smoothly and run reliably.

    Similarly, programming languages has wrestled with issues of expressivity and tractability, and intensional and extensional representation, a distinction which has long since been reconciled by the statistical learning community under the umbrella of model-based learning and approximation theory. PL could take a page from structured inference and propagation algorithms as a medium for distributed computation\ldots We believe many other such examples await discovery.

    Other areas where the interaction could be fruitful are tools for equivalence, proof search and metrics. A deeper understanding of programming langauge semantics are largely missing from neural program synthesis discussions. New language models could enable natural langauge and assitive programming.

    As outlined above, we believe that recent advances in statistical learning and programming languages have been largely siloed, and these two communities have many ideas to exchange. A joint workshop could help to facilitate yet unrealized research connections. Our workshop is designed to be as inclusive as possible. For illustration, we include the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Differentiable programming / automatic differentiation
      \item Probabilistic programming / statistical inference
      \item Declarative programming / constraint programming
      \item Dynamic programming / reinforcement learning
      \item Functional programming / $\lambda$-calculus
      \item Array programming / linear algebra
      \item Semiring programming / message passing
      \item Metaprogramming / reflection
      \item Logic programming / proof search
      \item Domain-specific languages
    \end{itemize}

    We encourage developers of libraries and frameworks to submit their work for evaluation.
